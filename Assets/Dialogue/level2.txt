The adrenaline-fueled chaos had descended upon the once serene campus, and the girls found themselves thrust into a situation they
couldn't comprehend. As the undead closed in, panic set in, but survival instincts kicked in just as fast.
Zombies? Seriously?! I thought those were just in movies, this cannot be real!
Save the disbelief for later. We need a plan, and fast!
Amidst the chaos, Mercedez, ever resourceful, grabbed her laptop and swung it at an approaching zombie.
Well, if they're real, we're not going down without a fight! Use whatever you can!
The girls grabbed their bags, pencils, and anything that could serve as a makeshift weapon.
Jennifer wielded her laptop like a makeshift shield, deflecting the undead onslaught.
If it wasn’t for his lack of eye and missing pinkie I’d say this is insane! But hey, better my laptop than my brains, right?
Head towards the GC or CP? We need to decide fast!
GC is closer, but CP might have fewer people. We need to think about getting to
Ruyi's dorm, since she’s the one that lives the closests. There are cars there, and we can find safety.
Ruyi, what do you think?
The whole campus should be borderline empty since everyone left home for the holidays.
I have no idea where so many of these zombies came from, but CP would be my choice,
it's always less crowded. Let's make a run for it. Fast and cautious, everyone!
The group, armed with pencils, makeshift shields, and laptops, made a daring dash through the campus grounds.
The air was thick with tension as they navigated through the undead, adrenaline pumping.
I can't believe we're doing this! We're like weird, undead Avengers or something.
Oh, or maybe we’re more like that early 2000’s french cartoon where the girls were spies or something.
As they reached the entrance of the CP, they paused to catch their breath, scanning the surroundings for any signs of danger.
The journey to Ruyi's dorm was fraught with peril, but the bond forged in the face of danger strengthened their resolve.
Little did they know, their survival skills would be tested even more before they reached the safety of Ruyi's dorm.
