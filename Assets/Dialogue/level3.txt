As the group caught their breath in the relative safety of the Charles Perry Building,
questions lingered in the air. The mysterious onslaught of zombies seemed too coordinated to be random.
Okay, seriously, what the heck is going on? Why are there so many of them?
It's like there was a zombie fraternity meeting or something.
A zombie fraternity? That’s like an average drama club social event.
Cute Mercedez, but we need answers, and fast. Ruyi, you have any idea why they're all over the place?
No clue. This is as strange to me as it is to you.
As they exchanged puzzled glances, Jennifer took a moment to check in on everyone.
Is everyone okay? Tired and nervous, but I’m assuming okay? No scrapes or bites right?
The affirmative responses echoed in the air, reassuring but laden with the weight of the situation.
So, what kind of zombies are we dealing with here? They don’t seem to be the super fast ones like in World War Z,
but definitely not as slow as The Walking Dead ones. Man those would make this like 10 times easier right now.
I suppose so, but honestly I’d prefer no zombies at all. They've got that chilled, slow-paced vibe, you know?
They're probably just looking for a beach party. Too bad for them, we’re in finals week.
A nervous chuckle passed among the group, momentarily lightening the grim atmosphere.
Alright, let's focus. We need a plan. DM is nearby and probably our next best bet; 
we can grab some fire extinguishers from the second floor. Use them as distractions or weapons as needed.
The group, armed with newfound determination, left the Charles Perry Building, 
navigating through the eerily quiet campus until they heard an eerie scream.
Someone was being attacked by a zombie, they rushed to help!
