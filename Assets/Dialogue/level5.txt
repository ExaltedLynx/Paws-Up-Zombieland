We can't catch a break, can we? We barely survived that one!
Jennifer, scanning the situation, realized the grim truth.
We need to find another way. Let's go up! Up to the 7th floor, now!
The girls, their strength waning, pushed themselves to ascend the stairs. The seventh floor of the library offered a temporary sanctuary.
With a collective effort, they barricaded the doors, allowing them a precious couple of moments to catch their breath.
As they rested, the reality of the chaos outside revealed itself. Miami was in shambles. Accidents and fires painted the city in an
apocalyptic palette. They observed scattered survivors navigating through the mayhem. Most of them were either too far to fully contact
and others were going about their business as well.
We're not alone in this mess, but everyone is scattered.  Would it be best to head to CASE?
Ruyi could only shake her head in disagreement as she plopped down to the ground to take a deep breath.
With the number of zombies, CASE is suicide. VH might be our best bet. There seems to be some people hiding somewhere in there. We're
also right next to it. It could be our best way of getting to CASE without going to the lake, or either side of the paths around it.
Determined to reach VH, the group gathered their strength, removing the barricades. With a shared glance, they made a dash down the stairs,
only to be met with a heart-stopping sight. The largest horde of zombies awaited them at the base of the stairs, 
their collective groans creating a symphony of doom.
This is not good. Not good at all.
The group hesitated, strategizing their next move as the relentless horde closed in.
The descent to desperation had only just begun, but they could only do one thing and fight on.
